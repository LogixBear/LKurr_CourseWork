      <div class='content'>Cheese sandwiches can be grilled so that the bread toasts and the cheese melts (a dish referred to as a grilled cheese sandwich, or simply grilled cheese). A grilled cheese is often heated by placing the buttered slices of bread, with the cheese between the slices, on a frying pan or griddle.

Another form of cooked cheese sandwich is the cheese toastie or toastie, a dish particularly popular in the United Kingdom that is prepared by either baking or grilling a cheese sandwich in an oven, or toasting bag in an electric toaster, or using a pie iron in order to toast the bread and melt the cheese. Cheddar is the most common cheese used in a toastie.[citation needed] It is usually served as a snack, or as a (usually lunchtime) meal, in most cases with a side of salad.

Cooked bread and cheese is an ancient food according to food historians, popular across the world in many cultures. Evidence indicates that, in the U.S., the modern version of the grilled cheese sandwich originated in the 1920s when inexpensive sliced bread and American cheese became readily available.[citation needed] The cheese dream, an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich, became popular in the U.S. during the Great Depression.[3]

U.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling "American cheese filling sandwiches" during World War II.[4] Many versions of the grilled cheese sandwich can now be found on restaurant menus across the U.S. and internationally.


To retain the crunchiness of the bread, this grilled cheese sandwich is set on it's end. It is made of sharp cheddar cheese, and walnut bread, along, of course, with butter.
In the United States, grilled cheese sandwiches are often served with soup (usually tomato soup), and may be served as a whole meal in the United States and other countries.

Preparation[edit]

A grilled cheese sandwich is assembled by inserting a cheese filling between two slices of bread, which is then heated until the bread crisps and the cheese melts. It is sometimes combined with an additional ingredient such as peppers, tomatoes, or onions, though many other ingredients may be used.[5] Several different methods of heating the sandwich are used, depending on the region and personal preference. Common methods include being cooked on a griddle, grilled, fried in a pan or made in a panini grill or sandwich toaster. This last method is more common in the United Kingdom, where the sandwiches are normally called "toasted sandwiches" or "toasties", and in Australia, where they are called "jaffles or "toasties".
